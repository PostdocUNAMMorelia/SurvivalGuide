# Survival Guide

This is a survival guide for (especially foreign) postdocs in Morelia.

Please use the [wiki](https://github.com/PostdocUNAMMorelia/SurvivalGuide/wiki) to add new information, which can then be organised into a document.

This repository intends to house information that current postdocs would have liked to have known before they learned about it.
